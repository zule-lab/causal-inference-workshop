-   almost all of this content comes from Statistical Rethinking, a textbook and online course that is completely free and available by Richard McElreath
-   a good portion also comes from The Book of Why and other works by Judea Pearl
-   there are many scholars, ecologists and otherwise who use this method and explain it better than I ever will - resources at the end

-   the beauty of causal inference is that it relies on concepts that come very naturally to the human brain and is founded on using the expert scientific knowledge that every scientist brings to their studies

-   THIS DOES NOT CHANGE EVERYTHING - just gives you a framework to easily express what you already feel and know

## What is causal inference? {.incremental}

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: {.incremental}
-   the study of causes and effects: does X cause a change in Y?

-   is this different from correlation?

    -   a rooster cawing is highly correlated with the sun rise - did the rooster cause the sun to rise?

-   why do we not talk or learn about causation?

    -   the invention of correlation, eugenics, Pearson, drama, lack of mathematical tools
