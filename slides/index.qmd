-   the beauty of causal inference is that it relies on concepts that come very naturally to the human brain and is founded on using the expert scientific knowledge that every scientist brings to their studies

-   THIS DOES NOT CHANGE EVERYTHING - just gives you a framework to easily express what you already feel and know

## What is causal inference? {.incremental}

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
::: incremental
-   the study of causes and effects: does X cause a change in Y?

-   is this different from correlation?

    -   a rooster cawing is highly correlated with the sun rise - did the rooster cause the sun to rise?

## Why don't we talk or learn about causation?

-   Pearson & Galton, founders of modern statistics, failed in creating the tools needed for causal inference and subsequently decided that it was impossible and "unscientific"

    -   they used their enormous influence to teach generations of scientists this and attack anyone who opposed them

-   Judea Pearl invented the math required to answer causal questions only \~ 40 years ago! Science is slow!

-   causation is not controversial - we are just transitioning

## What is causal inference NOT?

-   <t style = "color: #f44336"> **prediction!! forecasting!!** </t>

<!-- -->

-   if we want to use our models to estimate data in places or times that we do not have data for, but we DO NOT CARE about the relationships between the things in our model, that is prediction and not causal inference

-   prediction is cool!! it is however, not what we do in our lab (for now...)

-   AIC is a tool for measuring the predictive power of your model - it is not appropriate for our purposes

Level 1: *association*

-   how are the variables related? how does changing X shift my belief in Y?

-   example: what does canopy cover tell us about air temperature?

-   DAGs (directed acyclic graphs)!

-   arrows indicate a causal relationship from one variable to another

-   use your expert knowledge + literature to outline your system with your hypotheses and assumptions (you already make assumptions now, you just don't visualize them!)

-   adjust your statistical test (e.g., model) using your DAG

EXAMPLE: the effect of canopy cover on temperature (simplified)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fork-dag

library(ggdag)

fork_dag <- dagify(
  temp ~ canopy + SVF,
  canopy ~ SVF,
  labels = c(
    "temp" = "Temperature",
    "canopy" = "Canopy Cover",
    "SVF" = "Sky View Factor"
  ),
  coords = list(x = c(canopy = -1, SVF = 0, temp = 1), 
                y = c(canopy = 1, SVF = 0, temp = 1)),
  exposure = "canopy",
  outcome = "temp"
)

ggdag(fork_dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "label") + theme_dag()

```

-   how do we know how to adjust our model?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fork-dag-adjustment

ggdag_adjustment_set(fork_dag, effect = "direct", text = FALSE, use_labels = "label", shadow = TRUE) + 
  theme_dag()

```

-   our DAG shows us that if we want to understand the effect of canopy cover on temperature, we need to add sky view factor to our model ("adjust for sky view factor")
-   our model may look something like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: fork-dag-model

library(lme4)

temp_model <- lmer(temperature ~ canopy + SVF + (1|date),
                   data = temp_df)


```

## Confounders: pipe {.scrollable}

-   what if we want to use the same example but understand the effect of SVF on temperature?
-   this is now a different type of collider, a pipe!

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   X and Y are associated

-   influence of X on Y is transmitted through Z

-   Once stratified by Z, X and Y have no association
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Statistical Rethinking, Lecture 5](presentation_imgs/pipe.png)
:::
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: pipe-dag

pipe_dag <- dagify(
  temp ~ canopy + SVF,
  canopy ~ SVF,
  labels = c(
    "temp" = "Temperature",
    "canopy" = "Canopy Cover",
    "SVF" = "Sky View Factor"
  ),
  coords = list(x = c(canopy = -1, SVF = 0, temp = 1), 
                y = c(canopy = 1, SVF = 0, temp = 1)),
  exposure = "SVF",
  outcome = "temp"
)

ggdag(pipe_dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "label") + theme_dag()

```

-   the effect of SVF on temperature is both a direct effect and an effect that pipes through canopy
-   if we want to understand the total effect of sky view factor on temperature, we DO NOT add canopy to our models

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: pipe-dag-adjustment

ggdag_adjustment_set(pipe_dag, effect = "total", text = FALSE, use_labels = "label", shadow = TRUE) + 
  theme_dag()

```

-   there is no adjustment set! everything rests "unadjusted"
-   because the effect of SVF goes through canopy, adding canopy to your model blocks that effect
-   your model might look like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: pipe-dag-model

temp_model <- lmer(temperature ~ SVF + (1|date),
                   data = temp_df)

```

## Confounders: collider {.scrollable}

::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   X and Y are not associated (share no causes)

-   X and Y both influence Z

-   Once stratified by Z, X and Y appear associated
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Statistical Rethinking, Lecture 5](presentation_imgs/collider.png)
:::

EXAMPLE: public and private tree species richness

-   both public tree species richness and private tree species richness contribute to the urban forest's functional diversity
-   however, public tree species richness does not influence private tree species richness and vice versa 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: collider-dag

collider_dag <- dagify(
  func ~ public + private,
  labels = c(
    "func" = "Urban Forest Functional Diversity",
    "public" = "Public Tree Species Richness",
    "private" = "Private Tree Species Richness"
  ),
  coords = list(x = c(public = -1, func = 0, private = 1), 
                y = c(public = 0, func = 0, private = 0))
)

ggdag(collider_dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "label") + theme_dag()

```

-   BUT if we have a model for private tree species richness with both urban forest functional diversity and public tree species richness included, an association between public and private species richness will appear when it does not truly exist

-   "spurious correlation"

## Confounders: descendant {.scrollable}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   descendant can be different depending on what it is attached to 

-   X and Y are causally associated through Z 

-   A holds information about Z

-   if stratified by A, X and Y are less associated
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![Statistical Rethinking, Lecture 5](presentation_imgs/descendant.png)
:::
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: descendant-dag

collider_dag <- dagify(
  bird ~ native,
  native ~ land,
  invasive ~ native,
  labels = c(
    "bird" = "Bird Behaviour",
    "native" = "Proportion Native Trees",
    "invasive" = "Proportion Invasive Trees",
    "land" = "Land Use Type"
  ),
  coords = list(x = c(land = -1, native = 0, invasive = 0, bird = 1), 
                y = c(land = 0.5, native = 0.5, invasive = 0, bird = 0.75))
)

ggdag(collider_dag, text = FALSE, use_labels = "label") + theme_dag()

```

-   we know from before that we shouldn't add proportion of native trees to our model if we want to test the effect of land use type on bird behaviour because its a pipe
-   because proportion of invasive trees is a descendant, adding it to the model will have the same effect but weaker 
-   descendants can be used as proxies for our variables of interest


## Adjusting your models for confounders

-   to test the effect of X on Y, we need to identify which variables we need to adjust (aka add to the model) to block all confounding paths

-   confounders are complex when there are more than 4 or 5 variables in the system

-   to figure out what variables you need to adjust, we can use dagitty!

## Some DAG notes / a petit sermon {.smaller}

1.  variables that do not have shared causes in your system do not need to be included - your DAG does not need to include every variable in the world

2.  do NOT exclude variables just because you haven't measured them, these are still potential confounders and need to be part of your DAG!

3.  you are an expert with good intuition and expertise, don't be scared to put your assumptions down on paper

4.  presenting the assumptions you are making about your system is good, transparent science and allows the development of the field

    -   !! you are doing this anyways !! when you decide what variables to collect / what to include in your models, you are just being less transparent about it! we must always do our best and be brave!


## Table 2 fallacy

-   each variable has its own set of adjustments it needs in order to test its effects
-   therefore, **not all coefficients in a summary table are causal relationships**
    -   check your DAG!
-   this is described as the "Table 2 Fallacy" - we can only interpret the effect(s) that we have adjusted for, not everything in our summary table
-   [The table 2 fallacy: presenting and interpreting confounder and modifier coefficients](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23371353/)
